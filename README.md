# [Python] RFM Analysis and Customer Segmentation Visualization

## I. Introduction
In business, understanding customer behavior is key to informed decisions and loyalty. RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis categorizes customers by purchasing patterns. Using Python's data analysis, we can efficiently streamline RFM analysis for actionable insights.

### Dataset 

| Fields | Description 
|-|-
|**InvoiceNo:** |Invoice number. Nominal, a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with letter 'C', it indicates a cancellation.
|**StockCode:** |Product (item) code. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.
|**Description:** |Product (item) name. Nominal.
|**Quantity:** |The quantities of each product (item) per transaction. Numeric.
|**InvoiceDate:** |Invoice Date and time. Numeric, the day and time when each transaction was generated.
|**UnitPrice:** |Unit price. Numeric, Product price per unit in sterling.
|**CustomerID:** |Customer number. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.
|**Country:**|Country name. Nominal, the name of the country where each customer resides.

### Key Components

1. Data Collection: Gather transaction data, including purchase dates, purchase frequency, and the monetary value of each transaction.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
3. RFM Scoring: Assign scores for recency, frequency, and monetary value to each customer, creating a comprehensive RFM score.
4. Segmentation: Categorize customers into segments based on their RFM scores, identifying high-value and at-risk customers.
5. Visualization: Utilize Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visual representations of the RFM segments for easy interpretation.
6. Actionable Insights: Interpret the results to formulate strategies that enhance customer engagement and boost sales.
